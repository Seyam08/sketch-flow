# Sketch Flow Documentation

**A prototype project** inspired by diagramming and flowchart tools. This is the **first version** built to experiment with shape drawing and canvas interactions. It’s still in the early stages, but it lays the foundation for a more advanced flowcharting tool. Future updates will introduce arrows, text inside shapes, styling options, and import/export functionality.

## 🌟 Current Features (Prototype)

- 🖌️ **Draw Shapes** – Create basic shapes on the canvas:
  - Rectangle
  - Circle
  - Square
  - Diamond
- 🔄 **Move Shapes** – Drag and reposition shapes anywhere on the canvas.
- 🧹 **Clear All** – Reset the canvas with a single action.

## 🚀 Planned Features

This is only the **prototype version**. Upcoming improvements include:

- ➡️ **Arrows** – Connect shapes with directional arrows
- 🔗 **Join Shapes** – Build flowcharts by linking shapes together
- ✍️ **Text Inside Shapes** – Add labels or descriptions inside each shape
- 🎨 **Customization** – Change shape color, border stroke, and canvas background
- 📤📥 **Export & Import** – Save and load your diagrams
